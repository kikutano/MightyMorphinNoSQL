# MightyMorphinNoSQL
This is a toy projects! The goal is to create a **NoSQL Database** from scratch, super light, without dependencies just for fun and learning. It's a good idea? No. So why? Why not?!

### Usage:
You can add rows using this command:
```
main.exe insert <content>
main.exe find <id>
main.exe insert_one_millions (insert one million of rows!)
```

For now find by id can reach the result in ~150ms in the wrost case scenario. My goal is to create the fastest queries to retrieve result as soon as I can. It's for learning purpose! :D
