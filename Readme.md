# MightyMorphinNoSQL
This is a **toy projects!** The goal is to create a **NoSQL Database** from scratch, super light, without dependencies just for fun and learning. This database uses **Append-Only Log** paradigm for inserting and Indexing to retrieve data. It's a good idea? No. So why? Why not?!

**Be patient, I'm writing a lot of documentation as I write code, but, in this phase I'm rewriting a lot of code. So documentation will come when I start to consolidate some principle :P**

For now this project allow you to write row on a single database and uses indexing to retrieve data by Id. 

## Supported Operations:
- Inserting data 
- Retrieve data by id
